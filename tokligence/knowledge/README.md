## 🌐 Vision

**We're not building just another LLM gateway. We're building an open-source AI gateway that enables two-way token trading.**

### Why This Matters

AI is becoming as essential as water and electricity. However, LLM token supply capacity should not be concentrated only in the hands of a few tech giants like OpenAI. We hope:

- 🔌 **AI should be infrastructure** - Open and transparent, not controlled by a few platforms
- 🔄 **Every consumer can be a provider** - Your excess LLM token capacity can serve others, like Bitcoin mining democratized finance
- 🌍 **The future is distributed** - Build a global decentralized token marketplace where ordinary people can also become token providers

### The Game-Changing Difference: Two-Way Trading

```
Traditional Gateways:  User → Gateway → Provider                       (one-way consumption)
Tokligence Gateway:    User (with GPU & self-hosted LLM) ↔ Gateway ↔ Token Marketplace (buy AND sell tokens)
```

With Tokligence, every installation becomes a node in a global AI token network. You can:
- **Buy** tokens to meet AI needs
- **Sell** unused LLM token throughput to the token marketplace
- **Arbitrage** between different prices and availability

**Our prediction**: The future of AI isn't centralized providers, but a mesh network where every enterprise or individual with self-hosted LLM can sell excess token throughput.

---

> **TL;DR**: Tokligence Gateway is a Golang-native, high-performance LLM gateway that not only provides unified access to multiple LLM providers but also enables you to sell your unused LLM token throughput to the marketplace. Think of it as Airbnb for AI tokens.

## Overview

Tokligence Gateway is a **platform-independent** LLM gateway that provides **dual native API support** - both OpenAI and Anthropic protocols - with full bidirectional translation. The gateway prioritizes:

1. **Dual Protocol Native Support**: Native OpenAI and Anthropic APIs running simultaneously with zero adapter overhead
2. **Platform Independence**: Runs standalone on any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) without external dependencies
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Multiple installation options - pip, npm, Docker, or standalone binary
4. **Intelligent Work Modes**: Auto, passthrough, or translation modes for flexible request handling
5. **Token Trading**: Optional two-way token trading capabilities

## ⚡ Performance

Tokligence Gateway delivers exceptional performance with minimal resource footprint and industry-leading cost efficiency.

## Why Tokligence Gateway?

**Freedom from vendor lock-in**
Switch providers with a configuration change. No code rewrites, no migration pain.

**Privacy and control**
Keep sensitive prompts and data on your infrastructure. You decide what goes where.

**Cost optimization**
Route requests to the most cost-effective provider for each use case. Track spending in real-time.

**Reliability and failover**
Automatic fallback to alternative providers when your primary goes down. No single point of failure.

**Transparency and accountability**
Your gateway logs every token, every request, every cost. When providers make billing errors or token counting mistakes, you have the data to prove it. No more black-box charges.

**Model audit and performance tracking**
Detect when providers silently degrade service—slower responses, lower quality outputs, or throttled throughput. Your ledger creates an audit trail that reveals pattern changes over time, protecting you from stealth downgrades.

## Scenarios

- **OpenAI Codex → Anthropic Claude**: Point Codex to `http://localhost:8081/v1` (OpenAI-compatible). The gateway translates Chat Completions and Responses API requests to Anthropic, handles tool calling, and prevents infinite loops. Full support for Codex CLI v0.55.0+ including streaming, tools, and automatic duplicate detection. See [docs/codex-to-anthropic.md](docs/codex-to-anthropic.md).
- **Claude Code integration**: Point Claude Code to `http://localhost:8081/anthropic/v1/messages` (SSE). The gateway translates to OpenAI upstream and streams Anthropic‑style SSE back. Set `TOKLIGENCE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and you're ready. See [docs/claude_code-to-openai.md](docs/claude_code-to-openai.md).
- **Google Gemini integration**: Point your application to `http://localhost:8084/v1beta` for native Gemini API access or use the OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `http://localhost:8084/v1beta/openai/chat/completions`. The gateway provides pass-through proxy support for both Gemini native and OpenAI-compatible formats with SSE streaming. See [docs/gemini-integration.md](docs/gemini-integration.md).
- **Drop‑in OpenAI proxy**: Change your SDK base URL to the gateway `/v1` endpoints to get central logging, usage accounting, and routing without changing your app code.
- **Multi‑provider switching**: Route `claude*` to Anthropic, `gpt-*` to OpenAI, and `gemini-*` to Google Gemini with a config change; switch providers without touching your agent code.
- **Team gateway**: Run `gatewayd` for your team with API keys, a per‑user ledger, and small CPU/RAM footprint.
- **Local dev/offline**: Use the built‑in `loopback` model and SQLite to develop/test SSE flows without calling external LLMs.

## Quick Start & Configuration

See [docs/QUICK_START.md](docs/QUICK_START.md) for setup, configuration, logging, and developer workflow.

### Tokligence Gateway CLI Chat (`tgw chat`)

When installed via the npm package (`@tokligence/gateway`), you get an interactive CLI assistant for configuring and troubleshooting the gateway:

```bash
tgw chat
```

Example `tgw chat` session:

![Tokligence Gateway CLI Chat](data/images/tgw_chat_config_example.png)

The assistant:

- Detects available LLM endpoints (local LLMs, commercial APIs, running gateway)
- Helps you switch work modes (e.g. `auto`, `translation`, `passthrough`)
- Suggests concrete commands you can copy-paste, such as:

```bash
export TOKLIGENCE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
tgw config set work_mode translation
```

To protect secrets and comply with modern data protection practices, API keys/tokens/secrets are kept local (only masked summaries like length/prefix or `*_configured` flags are ever sent to remote LLM providers.

## Architecture


### Dual Protocol Architecture

The gateway exposes **both OpenAI and Anthropic API formats** simultaneously, with intelligent routing based on your configuration:

```

### Multi-Port Architecture

**Default Mode (Single-Port)**: The gateway runs on facade port **:8081** by default, exposing all endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, admin) on a single port for simplicity.

**Multi-Port Mode (Optional)**: Enable `multiport_mode=true` for strict endpoint isolation across dedicated ports:

| Config key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `multiport_mode` | Enable multi-port mode | `false` |
| `facade_port` | Main aggregator listener (all endpoints) | `:8081` |
| `admin_port` | Admin-only endpoints | `:8079` |
| `openai_port` | OpenAI-only endpoints | `:8082` |
| `anthropic_port` | Anthropic-only endpoints | `:8083` |
| `gemini_port` | Gemini-only endpoints | `:8084` |
| `facade_endpoints`, `openai_endpoints`, `anthropic_endpoints`, `gemini_endpoints`, `admin_endpoints` | Comma-separated endpoint keys per port | defaults in `internal/httpserver/server.go` |

Endpoint keys map to concrete routes:

- `openai_core`: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models`
- `openai_responses`: `/v1/responses`
- `anthropic`: `/anthropic/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages`, and their `count_tokens` variants
- `gemini_native`: `/v1beta/models/*` (native Gemini API and OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
- `admin`: `/api/v1/admin/...`
- `health`: `/health`

Example configuration enabling multi-port mode:

```ini
multiport_mode = true
facade_port = :8081
admin_port = :8079
openai_port = :8082
anthropic_port = :8083
gemini_port = :8084

openai_endpoints = openai_core,openai_responses,health
anthropic_endpoints = anthropic,health
gemini_endpoints = gemini_native,health
admin_endpoints = admin,health
```

The regression suite (`go test ./...` and `tests/run_all_tests.sh`) now exercises `/v1/responses` streaming on every listener to ensure the bridge produces the expected SSE sequence across ports.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Protocol | Purpose | Example Client |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI | Chat with tool calling support | OpenAI SDK, LangChain |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI | Responses API with session management | **Codex CLI v0.55.0+** |
| `GET /v1/models` | OpenAI | List available models | Any OpenAI client |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | OpenAI | Text embeddings | LangChain, OpenAI SDK |
| `POST /anthropic/v1/messages` | Anthropic | Native Anthropic chat | Claude Code |
| `POST /anthropic/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Anthropic | Token estimation | Claude Code |
| `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` | Gemini | Native Gemini chat completion | Google AI SDK |
| `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent` | Gemini | Native Gemini streaming | Google AI SDK |
| `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:countTokens` | Gemini | Token counting | Google AI SDK |
| `GET /v1beta/models` | Gemini | List Gemini models | Google AI SDK |
| `POST /v1beta/openai/chat/completions` | Gemini (OpenAI-compatible) | OpenAI-format on Gemini | OpenAI SDK with Gemini models |

### Routing Mechanism

The gateway routes requests based on **model name patterns**:

```bash
# Configuration via environment variable
TOKLIGENCE_ROUTES=claude*=>anthropic,gpt-*=>openai

# Examples:
model: "claude-3-haiku"     → Anthropic API
model: "claude-3.5-sonnet"  → Anthropic API
model: "gpt-4"              → OpenAI API
model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"      → OpenAI API
```

### Work Modes

The gateway supports three work modes for flexible request handling:

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **`auto`** (default) | Smart routing - automatically chooses passthrough or translation based on endpoint+model match | Best for mixed workloads; `/v1/responses` + gpt* = passthrough, `/v1/responses` + claude* = translation |
| **`passthrough`** | Delegation-only - direct passthrough to upstream providers, rejects translation requests | Force all requests to be delegated to native providers without translation |
| **`translation`** | Translation-only - only allows translation between API formats, rejects passthrough requests | Force all requests through the translation layer for testing or protocol conversion |

```bash
# Configuration via environment variable or INI
TOKLIGENCE_WORK_MODE=auto|passthrough|translation

# Or in config/dev/gateway.ini
work_mode=auto
```

**Examples**:
- `work_mode=auto`: `/v1/responses` with `gpt-4` → delegates to OpenAI; with `claude-3.5-sonnet` → translates to Anthropic
- `work_mode=passthrough`: Only allows native provider delegation (e.g., gpt* to OpenAI, claude* to Anthropic via their native APIs)
- `work_mode=translation`: Only allows cross-protocol translation (e.g., Codex → Anthropic via OpenAI Responses API translation)

### Key Features

1. **Protocol Transparency**: Clients choose their preferred API format (OpenAI or Anthropic)
2. **Flexible Routing**: Configuration-driven backend selection without code changes
3. **Automatic Format Conversion**: Seamless OpenAI ↔ Anthropic translation
4. **Tool Calling Support**: Full OpenAI function calling with Anthropic tools conversion
5. **Unified Logging**: All requests logged to a single ledger database

### Database Schema Compatibility
- Same schema across SQLite and PostgreSQL
- Automatic migrations on startup
- Clean upgrade path from Community to Enterprise

## Development

- Requirements: Go 1.24+, Node 18+ (if building the optional frontend), Make.
- For local workflow (build, run, scripts), see [docs/QUICK_START.md](docs/QUICK_START.md).

## Token Trading Network (optional)

When enabled, you can connect to the Tokligence token trading network to buy and sell token capacity. The gateway works fully offline by default.

## Updates & Minimal Telemetry

Optional daily update check sends only non‑PII basics (random install ID, version, platform/db). Disable with `TOKLIGENCE_UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED=false`. Core functionality works fully offline.

## Compatibility

- **OpenAI Codex CLI v0.55.0+**: Fully compatible with Codex CLI using Responses API. Supports streaming, tool calling, automatic shell command normalization, and duplicate detection to prevent infinite loops.
- **Claude Code v2.0.29**: Verified end‑to‑end with Anthropic `/v1/messages` over SSE. The gateway translates Anthropic requests to OpenAI as needed and streams Anthropic‑style SSE back to the client.

### ✅ Verified with Claude Code

Claude Code pointing at `http://localhost:8081/anthropic` (dummy API key, OpenAI key configured on gateway) talking to GPT via translation:

![Claude Code to GPT via Gateway](data/images/claude-to-gpt.png)

### Auto Mode: Model First, Endpoint Second

In `work_mode=auto`, the gateway first infers the provider from the requested `model` (via `model_provider_routes`, e.g., `gpt*→openai`, `claude*→anthropic`). That choice overrides endpoint hints; the endpoint (`/v1/messages`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`) only decides whether to translate or passthrough once the provider is known. Add vendor prefixes you trust (e.g., `o1*→openai`, `qwen*→ali`) via config rather than relying on broad wildcards. If the inferred provider is unavailable, the gateway translates via the other provider using the configured defaults.

When `TOKLIGENCE_CHAT_TO_ANTHROPIC=on` (or `chat_to_anthropic=true` in `gateway.ini`), this model-first policy also applies to the OpenAI Chat endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions` with a `claude*` model is translated to Anthropic `/v1/messages` (non‑streaming returns Anthropic JSON, streaming maps SSE back into OpenAI `chat.completion.chunk` events), while `gpt*` models continue to use native OpenAI Chat.

### ✅ Verified with Codex CLI

The gateway has been tested and verified with OpenAI Codex CLI in full-auto mode:

**Test Command:**
```bash
codex --full-auto --config 'model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"'
```

**Configuration:**
- Base URL pointed to gateway: `http://localhost:8081/v1`
- Model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` (Anthropic Claude)
- Mode: Full-auto with tool calling enabled
- API: OpenAI Responses API with streaming

**Screenshot:**

![Codex CLI with Gateway](data/images/codex-to-anthropic.png)

The test demonstrates:
- ✅ Seamless Codex → Gateway → Anthropic flow
- ✅ Tool calling (shell commands) working correctly
- ✅ Streaming responses in real-time
- ✅ Duplicate detection preventing infinite loops
- ✅ Automatic shell command normalization
